        He has just graduated and has a degree in \(wordController.verbs[0].word).
        He has experience teaching \(wordController.nouns[2].word) how to play games.
        He is \(wordController.adjectives[0].word) and \(wordController.adjectives[1].word).
        During vacations, he use to \(wordController.verbs[1].word) our \(wordController.adjectives[2].word) dogs.
